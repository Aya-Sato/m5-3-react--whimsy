# Workshop: Whimsical Animation

Today, we'll build an over-the-top "like" button, similar to the one found on Twitter.com:

![Twitter like button](__lecture/assets/demo.gif)

While it all happens quickly, there's actually quite a lot going on here! Specifically, we will need 3 distinct animations:

- A pink circle needs to rise up and "pop"
- The heart needs to swell up, in a springy motion
- Confetti particles need to burst out

We'll build them in turn :)

Before we get to the fun stuff, we have a some work to do. It looks like the workshop doesn't quite have everything we'd expect to see in a tweet. Specifically, the following things are missing:

- The date and time of the tweet
- The # of retweets
- The # of likes

Additionally, nothing actually works yet; we can't "like" or "retweet" the tweet!

This workshop is focused entirely on front-end UI stuff, so we don't need to worry about "real" data, but we do need to make sure that are components are well-architected.

## Starting point

Inside the workshop, you'll find a basic React app that loads the following Tweet:

![Initial view](./__lecture/assets/initial.png)

Take a few moments to investigate the provided folders and files. This project comes with a decent amount of scaffolding. Be sure to check out the various components (and the files within these directories):

- LikeButton
- Tweet
- UnstyledButton

### Component directory structure

This project uses a slightly different directory structure: each component gets its own folder in `src/components`. It looks like this:

```
src
â””â”€â”€ components
  â””â”€â”€ SomeComponent
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
    â””â”€â”€ SomeOtherComponent.js
```

```js
import Tweet from "../Tweet";
```

This import points to the _directory_, `src/components/Tweet`. When you point an import at a directory, it looks for an `index.js` inside; this is part of how Node.js module resolution works.

The `index.js` contains the component named `Tweet`. This format is useful when a component has at least one child component to itself. We can keep them in the same folder. It helps to keep our components more organized.

## Exercise 9: Taking whimsy to past projects

This workshop is all about whimsy. How can we apply these lessons to previous workshops?

Some ideas:

1. Add particle effects to the cookie clicker game!
2. In the routing workshop, we show a number of listings. What if they faded in sequentially, like dominos?
3. Have you seen an effective animation on the web? See if you can recreate it!
